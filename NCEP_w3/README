README for w3lib

14 Dec 1997  BUFRON29
-----------------------------------
This release of 'w3lib' for BUFRON29 contains only the routines needed
for running the BUFR -> ON29 converter program.

11 Mar 1999
-----------------------------------
Pruned file distribution to contain only those named in the Makefile,
i.e. only those used by routines that we are using.

28 Jun 1999
-----------------------------------
Added new routines for new PREPDATA (from NCEP via Genia)
Temporary replacement for W3MOVDAT routine - should consider
trying to obtain new copy of entire W3LIB code to make sure
files are up to date, and to get new date/time routines.

24 August 1999  Sienkiewicz
-----------------------------------
Note that the routines W3ERSUNB and W3UNPKB7 have been replaced
with dummy routines.  These routines require the new NCEP 
W3DIFDAT routine which we do not have.
	W3ERSUNB - read data from ERS BUFR file
	W3UNPKB7 - read data from Profiler, GOES sounding and NEXRAD files
Since we do not use PREPDATA to process these data types, they are not
currently needed.  Were we to wish to process these datatypes however
the missing date routines would also need to be obtained.

Merged two versions of this library as it stood in the
GMAO repository, these being: paqc/w3lib and the fvssi/w3. 
Basically what I did was to preserve the w3 lib as from
the fvssi/ system and add the missing files from the version
under paqc. On top of that, there were three files that were
common to both versin and yet different: w3movdat.f, w3tagb.f, xmovex.f
off these, the only one really different is w3tagb.f which I chose to
keep the one from the fvssi version since it seemed to be newer and 
because I have tested things for GSI w/ this file in place rather
than the one in the paqc. It remains to be seen that this doesn't mess
up anything related to prevents/paqc/etc.

Now, in trying to create the 3-precision libraries I stamble onto
the problem of not being able to compiler two routines under -i4,
these being: w3ai38 and w3ai39. In order to compile them, I changed
the declaration of the hexadecimal array defined in the DATA statements
in each routine to be interger*8. I am not 100% sure there will be
no impact at runtime related to this.

The presence of mova2i in this w3 library creates a circular dependency
between the buffer and this w3 library. I suppose mova2a also does not
below here.

TBD:  - resolve circular dependency between bfr and w3 (mova2i)
      - move iw3 routines somewhere else

-------------------
- removed cft77 from the library; it's redundant and it gives trouble on 
  the compaq; sgi might simply be hidding the potential problems.

Replace a few routines with "newer" versions I've tested.
 w3ai38.f w3ai39.f  from NCEP (Ricardo's Int*8 from 15 July is OK, though, 
                       as it's also in the NCEP versions)

 errexit.f       I added 'CALL EXIT' which will allow exit codes to be 
                     passed to shell on exit.

 w3movdat.f      remove my "temporary" replacement routine & add NCEP routine.
 w3fi04.f        from NCEP - 'SAVE' statement removed.
