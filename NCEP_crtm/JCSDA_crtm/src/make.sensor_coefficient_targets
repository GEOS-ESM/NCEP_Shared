# NAME:
#       make.sensor_coefficient_targets
#
# PURPOSE:
#       Unix make utility include file for linking in the sensor-specific
#       SpcCoeff and TauCoeff data files required for CRTM initialisation.
#
#       Note that this include file is intended for use with the make.macros
#       and make.rules include files also.
#
# CALLING SEQUENCE:
#       include make.sensor_coefficient_targets
#
# REQUIRED MACRO DEFINITIONS:
#       ENDIAN_TYPE
#         Defines the byte-sex of the files to link in.
#         Must be defined as either
#           "Big_Endian"
#         or
#           "Little_Endian"
#         in the containing makefile.
#
#       TAUCOEFF_TYPE
#         Defines the type of transmittance model TauCoeff file to link in.
#         Must be defined as either
#           "ODAS"
#         or
#           "ODPS"
#         in the containing makefile.
#
#       SENSOR_IDS
#         Defines the list of sensors for which the coefficients
#         are to be linked in. Follows the standard CRTM Sensor_Id
#         naming convention.
#
# PROVIDED TARGETS
#       create_sensor_coeff_links::
#         Invoke this target to create the links to the specified sensor
#         coefficient files.
#
#       remove_sensor_coeff_links::
#         Invoke this target to delete the links to the specified sensor
#         coefficient files.
