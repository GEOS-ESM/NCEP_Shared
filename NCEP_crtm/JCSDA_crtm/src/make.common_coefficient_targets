#
# NAME:
#       make.common_coefficient_targets
#
# PURPOSE:
#       Unix make utility include file for linking in the common coefficient
#       data files required during CRTM initialisation.
#
#       Note that this include file is intended for use with the make.macros
#       and make.rules include files also.
#
# CALLING SEQUENCE:
#       include make.common_coefficient_targets
#
# REQUIRED MACRO DEFINITIONS:
#       ENDIAN_TYPE
#         Defines the byte-sex of the files to link in.
#         Must be defined as either
#           "Big_Endian"
#         or
#           "Little_Endian"
#         in the containing makefile.
#
# PROVIDED TARGETS
#       create_common_coeff_links::
#         Invoke this target to create the links to the common CRTM
#         coefficient files.
#
#       remove_common_coeff_links::
#         Invoke this target to delete the links to the common CRTM
#         coefficient files.
