0) PREAMBLE
-----------
   The build makefile assumes that environment variables (envars) will
   be defined that describe the compilation and link environment. The envars
   that must be defined are:
     FC:       the Fortran95/2003 compiler executable,
     FC_FLAGS: the flags/switches provided to the Fortran compiler,
     FL:       the linker used to create the executable test/example programs,
     FL_FLAGS: the flags/switches provided to the linker.

   Several shell (sh, or bash. No csh, sorry) source files are provided for the
   compilers to which we have access and have tested. These shell source files
   are in the "configure/" subdirectory of the tarball.

   The current list of test compiler environments in the configure/ directory
   are:

     $ ls configure/
     g95.setup             ifort.setup        xlf.setup
     g95_debug.setup       ifort_debug.setup  xlf_debug.setup
     gfortran.setup        pgi.setup
     gfortran_debug.setup  pgi_debug.setup



1) COMPILATION ENVIRONMENT SETUP
--------------------------------
   To set the compilation envars for your library build, you need to source the
   required "setup" file. For example, to use gfortran to build the library you
   would type

     . configure/gfortran.setup

   in the main directory. Note the "." and space preceding the filename.
   This should print out something like the following:

     =========================================
      CRTM compilation environment variables:
        FC:       gfortran
        FC_FLAGS:  -c  -O3  -fconvert=big-endian  -ffast-math  -ffree-form
                   -fno-second-underscore  -frecord-marker=4  -funroll-loops
                   -ggdb  -static  -Wall
        FL:       gfortran
        FL_FLAGS:
     =========================================

   indicating the values to which the envars have been set.

   Change the current setups to suit your needs. If you use a different compiler
   please consider submitting your compilation setup to be included in future
   releases.

   Note that the Fortran compiler needs to be compatible with the ISO TR-15581
   Allocatable Enhancements update to Fortran95. Most current Fortran95 compilers
   do support TR-15581.



	2) LIBRARY BUILD
	----------------
	   In the main directory type

	     make

	   to start building the Sensor Planck Utility library.



	3) EXAMPLE PROGRAM
	------------------
	   Once the library is built, type

	     make example

	   to build and run an example program that reads the supplied GOES-R ABI
	   SpcCoeff datafile. The SpcCoeff data for other sensors are available
	   from the CRTM release tarball.

	   The screen output for the example run using the GOES-R ABI SpcCoeff data
	   looks something like:

     Enter an SpcCoeff filename to read: abi_gr.SpcCoeff.bin
 SpcCoeff_ReadFile(Binary)(INFORMATION) : FILE: abi_gr.SpcCoeff.bin;
 SpcCoeff RELEASE.VERSION:  8.02
   N_CHANNELS=10

       abi_gr channel list:
    7    8    9   10   11   12   13   14   15   16


     Enter a temperature in Kelvin (-ve to quit): 273

     Enter a sensor channel (-ve to quit): 5
Channel 5 is not a valid channel for abi_gr. Try again...

     Enter a sensor channel (-ve to quit): 7

       abi_gr channel 7; T=   273.000K
         R     =      0.279
         Tb    =    273.000
         dB/dT =      0.014
         dT/dB =     72.782


     Enter a sensor channel (-ve to quit): 15

       abi_gr channel 15; T=   273.000K
         R     =     89.332
         Tb    =    273.000
         dB/dT =      1.422
         dT/dB =      0.704



	4) LIBRARY INSTALLATION
	-----------------------
	   To install the library in the ./lib and ./include directories, type

	     make install

	   You can then copy/move/link these directories to the preferred location
	   on your system.



	5) CLEANUP
	----------
	   Two cleanup targets are provided in the makefile:

	     make clean

	   Removes all the compilation and link products from the libsrc/ directory.

	     make distclean

	   This does the same as the "clean" target but also deletes the library
	   and include directories created by the "install" target.



	6) FEEDBACK AND CONTACT INFO
	----------------------------
	   That's really it. Any questions or bug reports can be sent to CRTM Support at

	     ncep.list.emc.jcsda_crtm.support@noaa.gov

	   Constructive suggestions for improving the build procedure(s) are welcome too.
