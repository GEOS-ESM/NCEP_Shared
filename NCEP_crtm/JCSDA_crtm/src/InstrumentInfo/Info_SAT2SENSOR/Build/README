Building the Info_SAT2SENSOR software.
======================================

1) Default build targets
   ---------------------
The included make file and its associated macro files contain default
build targets for the following platforms/compilers:
  - SunOS
  - AIX
  - IRIX64
  - Linux
  - Darwin (MacOSX)
  
The default build will select the system based on the operating system.
For the "Linux" and "Darwin" platforms, the default Fortran95 compiler
is g95. If it's not installed on your system and you want to use it, you
can obtain your platform's binary from
  http://www.g95.org
  
To use the default build, simply type

  make
  

 
2) Specific build targets
   ----------------------
The supplied specific build targets are:
  AIX:          ibm
  IRIX64:       sgi
  SunOS:        sun
  Linux/Darwin: intel
                lahey
                pgi
                g95

So, if you are on a linux system with the Intel compiler, you can type

  make intel
  
to override the default compiler designation (g95). There are corresponding
debug targets for each of the above, identified with the suffix "_debug". So,
for example, to compile on an IBM AIX system with debug options you would type

  make ibm_debug
  
All recognised compiler flags are listed in the make.macros file.



3) Other targets
   -------------
To clean the build directory, type

  make clean

To install the executable into your ${HOME}/bin directory,
if it exists, type

  make install
